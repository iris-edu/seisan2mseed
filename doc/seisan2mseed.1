.SH NAME
SeisAn to Mini-SEED converter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
seisan2mseed [options] file1 [file2 file3 ...]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBseisan2mseed\fP converts SeisAn waveform data files to Mini-SEED.
One or more input files may be specified on the command line.  If an
input file name is prefixed with an '@' character the file is assumed
to contain a list of input data files, see \fILIST FILES\fP below.

The default translation of SeisAn components to SEED channel codes is
as follows: a 3 character SEED channel is composed of the first,
second and fourth characters of the component; furthermore if the
second character is a space and the first and fourth are not spaces
an 'H' is substituted for the 2nd character (i.e. 'S__Z' -> 'SHZ').
Other translations may be explicitly specified using the -T command
line option.

By default all created Mini-SEED records are written to stdout.  The
output data may be re-directed to a file using the -o option.


.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V         "
Print program version and exit.

.IP "-h         "
Print program usage and exit.

.IP "-v         "
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-S         "
Include SEED blockette 100 in each output record with the sample rate
in floating point format.  The basic format for storing sample rates
in SEED data records is a rational approximation
(numerator/denominator).  Precision will be lost if a given sample
rate cannot be well approximated.  This option should be used in those
cases.

.IP "-B         "
Buffer all input data into memory before packing it into Mini-SEED
records.  The host computer must have enough memory to store all of
the data.  By default the program will flush it's data buffers after
each input block is read.

.IP "-n \fInetcode\fP"
Specify the SEED network code to use, if not specified the network
code will be blank.  It is highly recommended to specify a network
code.

.IP "-l \fIloccode\fP"
Specify the SEED location code to use, if not specified the location
code will be blank.

.IP "-r \fIbytes\fP"
Specify the Mini-SEED record length in \fIbytes\fP, default is 4096.

.IP "-e \fIencoding\fP"
Specify the Mini-SEED data encoding format, default is 11 (Steim-2
compression).  Other supported encoding formats include 10 (Steim-1
compression), 1 (16-bit integers) and 3 (32-bit integers).  The 16-bit
integers encoding should only be used if all data samples can be
represented in 16 bits.

.IP "-b \fIbyteorder\fP"
Specify the Mini-SEED byte order, default is 1 (big-endian or most
significant byte first).  The other option is 0 (little-endian or
least significant byte first).  It is highly recommended to always
create big-endian SEED.

.IP "-o \fIoutfile\fP"
Write all Mini-SEED records to \fIoutfile\fP instead of stdout.

.IP "-T \fIcomp=chan\fP"
Specify an explicit component to channel mapping, this option may be
used several times (e.g. '-T SBIZ=SHZ -T SBIN=SHN -T SBIE=SHE').

.SH LIST FILES
If an input file is prefixed with an '@' character the file is assumed
to contain a list of file for input.  The list can be either simple
text, with one file per line, or the format created by the SeisAn dirf
command (filenr.lis).

An example of a simple test list:

.nf
2003-06-20-0643-41S.EDI___003
2005-07-23-1452-04S.CER___030
.fi

An example of an equivalent list in the dirf (filenr.lis) format:

.nf
 #  1  2003-06-20-0643-41S.EDI___003
 #  2  2005-07-23-1452-04S.CER___030
