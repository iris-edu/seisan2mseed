	- Read list files after done parsing all command line options,
	the desired verbosity is then used, etc.

2005.279: 0.6
	- The default output files are now the input file names with
	".mseed" suffix.

2005.278: 0.5
	- If an input file is prefixed with '@' it should be a list
	of input data files either in simple text or dirf (filenr.lis)
	format.
	- Change default packing to do a flushing pack at the end of
	each block.  The '-B' option can be used to buffer all of the
	input data before packing.
	- Add seisan2mseed.1 man page to doc directory.

2005.277:
	- fclose the input files after reading them.

2005.277: 0.4
	- Add option to perform the packing of data as it is read in.
	There are pros and cons either way.

2005.272: 0.3
	- Add parsing of format <= 6.0 PC files.
	- Pack data as it is read in, the output will be interleaved if
	multiple channels are in the input, but the timing flags will be
	set better this way and the converter will scale much better.
	- Remove signal handler, not needed.

2005.271: 0.2
	- Update to libmseed 1.3 with support for Win32.
	- Add Makefiles for Win32 except for base Makefile.win for nmake.

	for any Trace where the input data has an "uncertain time" flag.

2005.270: 0.1
	- Initial version.
