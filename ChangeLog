2007.284: 1.3

	- Fix reading of 16-bit (2 byte) integer samples.

2005.329: 0.8.2
	- Update to libmseed 1.4.4.
	- Add explicit text to man page and help message about
	'filenr.lis' being a special case list file.
	- List file parsing now assumes that the last, space
	separated field on each line is the filename; accomodates
	simple list files and various dirf (filenr.lis) formats.

2005.315: 0.8.1
	- Update to libmseed 1.4.3 which has a WIN32 define for 
	strcasecmp().

2005.314: 0.8
	- If the 3rd component character is not a space put it in the
	first character of the location code, default location code is
	now '00'.
	- 'filenr.lis' is now recognized as a list file.
	- Output file name now adds '_MSEED' unless it's a standard
	SeisAn file in which case the 'S' at character 19 is changed to
	an 'M'.
	- Upate to libmseed 1.4.2.
	- Update documentation, components with spaces must be quoted.

2005.280: 0.7
	- Add support for 16-bit (2 byte) integer samples.
	- Move input file format detection out of main loop and before
	creation of the output file.  If a SeisAn format cannot be
	detected the output will not be created.

2005.279: 0.6b
	- Read list files after done parsing all command line options,
	the desired verbosity is then used, etc.

2005.279: 0.6
	- The default output files are now the input file names with
	".mseed" suffix.

2005.278: 0.5
	- If an input file is prefixed with '@' it should be a list
	of input data files either in simple text or dirf (filenr.lis)
	format.
	- Change default packing to do a flushing pack at the end of
	each block.  The '-B' option can be used to buffer all of the
	input data before packing.
	- Add seisan2mseed.1 man page to doc directory.

2005.277:
	- fclose the input files after reading them.

2005.277: 0.4
	- Add option to perform the packing of data as it is read in.
	There are pros and cons either way.

2005.272: 0.3
	- Add parsing of format <= 6.0 PC files.
	- Pack data as it is read in, the output will be interleaved if
	multiple channels are in the input, but the timing flags will be
	set better this way and the converter will scale much better.
	- Remove signal handler, not needed.

2005.271: 0.2
	- Update to libmseed 1.3 with support for Win32.
	- Add Makefiles for Win32 except for base Makefile.win for nmake.
	- Set bit 7 in the data quality flags (time tag questionable)
	for any Trace where the input data has an "uncertain time" flag.

2005.270: 0.1
	- Initial version.
